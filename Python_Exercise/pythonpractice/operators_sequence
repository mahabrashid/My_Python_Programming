'''
Boolean operators aren't just evaluated from left to right. Just like with arithmetic operators, there's an order of operations for boolean operators:

not is evaluated first;
and is evaluated next;
or is evaluated last.
For example, True or not False and False returns True.

True or not False and False. not gets evaluated first, so we have
True or True and False. and goes next, so we get
True or False. As we've seen, True or False is True, so the value finally returned is True!
