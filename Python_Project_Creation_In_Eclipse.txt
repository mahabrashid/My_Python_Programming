A little note on How to create python project in eclipse from fresh

1. First create a workspace in the parent directory of the intended project directory. For example, if PythonProgramming\Python_Exercise is to be the intended project directory, then select PythonProgramming as the workspace directory. This will create .metadata folder in the PythonProgramming directory. It is important that the .metadata directory is not in the same location as the .project and .pydevproject files (which will be created in the project directory when the project is created).
2. Then create a project in the workspace with the same name as the intended project directory, i.e. Python_Exercise. This should create .project and .pydevproject files in the Python_Exercise directory. 
3. If the above doesn't succeed due to same names, then create yet another project by the same name (Python_Exercise) inside the Python_Exercise directory. This will create a subdirectory inside Python_Exercise directory by the same name containing the .project and .pydevproject files. Now copy the .project and .pydevproject files somewhere and delete the created Python_Exercise project in eclipse (also from the disk). Paste the files back into the original Python_Exercise directory and import into the workspace in eclipse.
